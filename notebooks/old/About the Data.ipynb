    "High performance computing (HPC) and open-source software revolutionize strategies for materials discovery by allowing the exploration of design spaces insurmountable by traditional research methods. This project establishes predictive tools and models for the publicly available ILThermo data distributed by the **National Institute of Science and Technology (NIST)**. In partnership with NIST, we leverage the immense amount of chemical and physical properties of ionic liquids (ILs) with data science and statistical methods **(RDKit, Scikit Learn)** to create publicly accessible data exploration and visualization tools. Specifically, via a built-in web application, site users are able to: 1) perform calculations of common statistical metrics, 2) generate machine learning models such as neural network (NN), least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), and support vector machine (SVM) regression to make property predictions of unknown ionic liquids, and 3) have access to sophisticated visual representations of their data selection and methods of coefficient confidence estimation to ascertain the robustness of their models and sensitivity to the underlying data.

    "LASSO is an excellent regression method for selecting features. Neural network (NN) models, however, typically have greater overall performance in their prediction accuracy due to their ability to select features and the networks they create. Therefore, for 1000 iterations we randomly created training and testing datasets, trained our LASSO models and used the top selected features to create NNs for the entire dataset and imidazolium subset.
